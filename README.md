With Wultra Mobile Token (WMT) SDK, you can integrate an out-of-band operation approval into an existing mobile app, instead of using a standalone mobile token application. WMT is built on top of [PowerAuth Mobile SDK](https://github.com/wultra/react-native-powerauth-mobile-sdk). Individual endpoints are described in the [Mobile Token API](https://developers.wultra.com/components/enrollment-server/develop/documentation/Mobile-Token-API).

To understand the Wultra Mobile Token SDK purpose on a business level better, you can visit our own [Mobile Token application](https://www.wultra.com/mobile-token). We use Wultra Mobile Token SDK in our mobile token application as well.

WMT SDK library does precisely this:

- Retrieves the list of operations that are pending for approval for a given user.
- Approves or rejects operations with PowerAuth transaction signing.
- Registers an existing PowerAuth activation to receive push notifications.

Remarks:

- This library does not contain any UI.
- We also provide an [Android](https://github.com/wultra/mtoken-sdk-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/wultra/mtoken-sdk-ios) version of this library.
